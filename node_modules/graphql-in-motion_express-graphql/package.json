  "description": "This serves as a modified version of the `express-graphql` package that has native support for subscriptions. Unfortunately, the [express-graphql](https://github.com/graphql/express-graphql), package does not have support for subscriptions. Support was introduced in [express-graphql/#436](https://github.com/graphql/express-graphql/pull/436), however movement on the PR has been all but quick.  This package implements that support for use in the GraphQL in motion course.",
